# Highgarden Landing Website

## How we created this example

This website has been built using Next.js and Now serverless services.

## Development

To develop a new branch please create a new branch with the following format `new/feature-to-include`, if it's a fix use `fix/this-needed-to-be-fixed` and so on.
To run the local environment run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

or just:

```
$ now dev
```

in order to run serverless functions in the local environment

## Deployment

Each Pull Request creates a new instance on `now`, each merge to `master` will be automatically deployed to `production`
